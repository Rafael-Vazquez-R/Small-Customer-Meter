This project aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the discrepancy between the 
water supplier's meter readings and those of small customer meters. The under-registration 
of water volume in the customer meters has resulted in lower billing compared to the actual 
water delivered.

To address this issue, we will analyze random customer water meters and explore questions 
related to the inaccuracies in meter readings.
